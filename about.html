    <h2>About Us:</h2>

    <p class="auto">Fun&Learn is an organization which was found on 1st July 2020 by Tayi Charan Kumar, student of electronics and communication engineering at NIE. The idea was to create a platform for students where they can have fun and as well as learn during the whole process
    </p>

    <p >Fun and learn was started during the pandemic, when students felt bad about the same monotonous life that they were leading. The name of our organization is resonant with its motive: That is to have Fun while we Learn. 
    </p>

    
    <p >We have conducted events throughout the pandemic with students and teachers participating in overwhelming numbers. The inaugural event was the online quiz show. After analysing a stupendous response, the theme was enlarged to other colleges as well. In the recent past, we have conducted talent shows, treasure hunts, event on stock market analysis and a recently concluded covid 19 awareness programme, all of which have turned out to be a huge success.
